# OMSS Backend Registry

This document contains a public registry of all backend services and frontend sites which use the Open Media Streaming Specification (OMSS).

The registry is maintained by the OMSS community and is open for contributions. If you want to add your service to the registry, please open a new issue or submit a pull request. An Administrator will review your submission and add it to the registry.

Frontends and backends listed here can either be open source or closed source, aslong as they implement the OMSS specification. The url in the `name` column should point to the service's endpoint or source code repository.

Ratings are provided based on community feedback, uptime and performance. Please note that ratings are subjective and may change over time as more feedback is received.
