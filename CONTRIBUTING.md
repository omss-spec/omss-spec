## 📋 Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** - Someone may have already reported it
2. **Read the specification** - Understand current design decisions
3. **Join discussions** - Ask questions before major work
4. **Start small** - Begin with documentation or minor fixes

## 🔄 Contribution Process

### For Minor Changes (Documentation, Examples)

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b improve-examples`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit with clear messages (`git commit -m "Add movie response example"`)
5. Push to your fork (`git push origin improve-examples`)
6. Open a Pull Request

### For Specification Changes

1. **Open an issue first** - Discuss the change before implementation
2. Explain the problem you're solving
3. Propose a solution
4. Get feedback from maintainers and community
5. If approved, follow the minor changes process above

### For Major Changes (New Features, Breaking Changes)

1. **Open an RFC (Request for Comments)**
2. Use the RFC template (see below)
3. Allow at least 2 weeks for community feedback
4. Address concerns and iterate on design
5. After consensus, create a draft specification
6. Submit Pull Request with the full proposal
